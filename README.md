Apple Game Porting Toolkit Installer

This public repository showcases using the brand-new **InstallAware Multi Platform** to completely automate the installation of Apple's new Game Porting Toolkit, making the process as simple as point-and-click - even for non-developers!

**If you are not a developer and are looking for a free way to run PC apps (and games) on your Mac, you may download a ready-to-run app built from this sample, notarized by Apple, at the URL below:

_This app works even on Intel Macs and does not require that you download the Apple Game Porting Toolkit from an Apple Developer account._

However, if you do have an Apple Silicon Mac and an Apple Developer account, this sample will also perform additional setup tasks to accelerate 3D games using Apple's brand-new technology.

Please note that you may run any Windows app using this sample, and are not limited to running games only.

If you are a developer, you may customize this sample following the steps below:

1) Please install **InstallAware Multi Platform** _RC0 Update 6a_ or newer from www.installaware.com/iamp/rc0.dmg. If you have previously installed **InstallAware Multi Platform**, just run the built-in update tool to upgrade to this version.
2) Please double-click the **MPRX project file** in the _Finder_ to open this sample in the **InstallAware Multi Platform** IDE. While your IDE may ship with an older version of this sample, always check the online repository for the latest version.
3) For human readable copies of the installation scripts, please take a look at https://github.com/installaware/AGPT/blob/main/Game%20Porting%20Toolkit%20Installer.miax.txt, https://github.com/installaware/AGPT/blob/main/sudo.miax.txt, and https://github.com/installaware/AGPT/blob/main/logging.miax.txt. Your IDE renders these scripts with syntax highlighting, code folding, undo/redo, etc.

This sample demonstrates intermediate coding techniques using **InstallAware Multi Platform**.
